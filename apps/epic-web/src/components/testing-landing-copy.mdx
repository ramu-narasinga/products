Mocking is a pain.

So much so that it leads the charts as the biggest pain point in the State of JS survey.

### A New Kind of Workshop

The Epic Web experience isn't sitting and watching videos.

Each workshop is contained within a specially designed web app that contains all of the exercises, code, and instructions you need to complete the workshop. The app is tightly integrated with your local development environment, so you can code and test your work in real time, in your real world work environment.

If you ever find yourself getting stuck, you have easy access to resources and diffs to help you get back on track. You'll also be invited to join the Epic Web community, where you can ask questions, share your progress, and even find a cohort to work through the workshop with.

After completing a workshop module, you'll be able to download a certificate of completion. Each certificate is served with a mechanism that proves to your team, your manager, or your future employer that you actually did the work. Share it with pride. You earned it.

- **Rising Full-Stack Devs:** Get the foundations right.
- **Veteran Coders:** Fill in the knowledge gaps you didn't know you had.

As an experienced engineer, I get the most value from seeing how Kent makes decisions and trade-offs while following best practices to build real-world apps. This stuff is gold dust, and it's super hard to find in online courses!

I've been a fullstack dev for ~5 years, but there were always areas I never fully grasped.

Kent's EpicWeb.dev demystified those areas and gave me confidence to start my own agency. I couldn't have done it without the knowledge from EpicWeb. Thank you Kent! ðŸš€
