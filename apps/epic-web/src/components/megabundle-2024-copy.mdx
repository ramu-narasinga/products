## Don't just build apps, build with confidence

I hear from developers around the world, doing so many different types of work, at all kinds of companies, and at all stages of their career.

Everybody's situation is unique, but there are a few things every developer has in common:

### Common Developer Challenges

- **Analysis paralysis:** When you've mostly learned on the job, or without guiding principles to inform your decisions, even the most experienced get caught in the trap of overanalyzing the details
- **Surprise side effects:** Or worse, they start making technical decisions without fully understanding the long-term implications
- **The technology treadmill:** On top of that, technology and industry norms keep changing. How do you make decisions that help you do your job today *and* take your career to the next level?

### The Missing Piece

**The feeling that something is missing.** And that *something* is the deep understanding of not only how things work, and what tools and approaches to choose, *but why*.

## What Exactly Makes Someone a "Master" of Their Craft?

You can already build web applications and solve day-to-day problems... But can you architect scalable solutions that stand the test of time? [BRIGHTLINE: UPDATE WITH SPECIFIC CAPABILITIES]

There's a huge difference between knowing how to solve your current problems and truly *mastering* web development.

### The Chef vs a Cook  

Consider the difference between how a chef approaches their work, vs a cook following recipes:

- Any cook, with access to the right tools and techniques, can follow someone else's instructions to create a good meal
- But a *chef* understands the principles behind why ingredients work together, and can create new recipes from scratch
- A *chef* can confidently experiment, solve problems as they arise, and create new solutions for any need
- A *chef* can help others too! They can foresee issues before they become dead ends, and adapt to nearly any situation

### True Web Development Mastery

Similarly, any web developer can follow tutorials to build things, but true *mastery* of the craft means working with a deeper understanding, which allows them to:

- Confidently experimenting with new approaches
- Foreseeing potential issues before they happen
- Helping others troubleshoot their challenges  
- Knowing when to use which tools (and when not to)
- Ultimately, make decisions from a consistent set of guiding principles

### The Epic Learning System

This level of understanding is exactly what I designed Epic Web Dev, Epic React, and my entire Epic Universe to help you accomplish!

Instead of just giving you "recipes" to follow, I take you through the principles behind every decision.

When combined with hands-on exercises, each new skill you learn also gives you the confidence to use it at the right place and time!

## Learn to solve technical problems today, tomorrow, and beyond

You don't have to absorb everything at once. In fact, you probably shouldn't! While some people do binge these courses, many developers tell us something different:

- They found *immediate* solutions to current work challenges
- They *retain* those solutions better than before
- They keep coming back to dive deeper, as they grow and encounter new challenges & decisions

Better than a course you take once and forget most of it, The EPIC bundle becomes their go-to reference, for when building new apps and tackling new challenges
