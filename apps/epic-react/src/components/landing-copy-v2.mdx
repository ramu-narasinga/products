{<h2 className="mx-auto max-w-sm text-balance text-center">Are you ready for the React 19 revolution?</h2>}
{<p className="text-center">The most in-demand JavaScript framework just got a massive upgrade!</p>}

<React19FeaturesStack />

{props.hasPurchasedV1 ? `You're not new to React, but with React 19 there` : 'There'} are 3 huge paradigm shifts that'll change your code (and maybe your life):

1. **React Suspense and Transitions:** cut out the kludges & take complete control over how you load data, sync & async, for the sleekest user experience
2. **Form and Server Actions:** ditch useEffect hacks forever (finally!) while delivering the exact data entry experience you want for SSR, SSG, and SPA apps
3. **'use client' and 'use server':** write server and client code in harmony, eliminating awkward transitions

Once you master the React 19 way, you'll be able to transform your codebase:

<CodebaseTransformation />

Your code will be better. Your coding experience will be better. React 19 is more fun to use because it finally gives you the complete set of tools you need to make a highly interactive, powerful web application without compromise.

And if you're new to the React ecosystem? You get to start fresh with the best React ever. Great timing!

It's a lot to learn. But it's worth it.

Now — experienced or newbie alike — you face a critical question:

**How will you master React 19?**

## {props.hasPurchasedV1 ? `I've taught React to over 30,000 people` : `Hi there, I'm Kent C. Dodds and I've taught React to over 30,000 people`}

<AboutKent>
  {props.hasPurchasedV1 ? `Epic React v1` : `My first Epic React course`} has
  helped so many people start new careers in React, and grow their existing
  ones. But I knew it could be even better… so when I set out to create all-new
  material for React 19, I also radically redesigned the entire experience.

  And I'll tell you all about that in a little bit.

  But first, there's something you should know about the practice of learning
  React, regardless of when, where, or how you want to learn it.

  Over the past 10 years, I've learned a lot about learning.

  And the biggest lesson of all?
</AboutKent>

### Not all learning is created equal.

You ever hear that old saying, It's not what you know, it's who you know?

We need an updated version for developers: _It's not what you know, it's how you know_. How you learn can influence the entire course of your career.

And here's the real rub:

### The way most people learn React will actively sabotage your future progress.

React is complex. It's got a lot of parts. Nobody wants to sit and read the docs for every single one of them before doing something. We all want to skip straight to the fun part — using all these tools, together, right away — to make things.

Making things feels like momentum.

But it's a trick.

The thing that truly separates experts from everyone else isn't special, advanced knowledge. It's total mastery of the basics. It's understanding the components. It's knowing how every part of the process works together in harmony to create the whole. It's being able to step outside the box of what you've done before and approach each new problem fresh using all the tools at your disposal.

That's what creates true confidence.

But when you go "fast" by rushing to the end result, dutifully re-typing code you don't yet understand, you speed past the very thing that will help you most. You miss the fundamentals you'll need every day in your career: planning, designing, debugging, maintaining, scaling. You cheat yourself out of future growth. You undermine your own confidence.

Luckily there's a better way.

### Here's how you become an _expert_

Based on observation, experiments, study, hundreds of hours of live teaching, and feedback from tens of thousands using my self-guided courses…

**This is the path to true expertise:**

- Master one concept at a time
- Start with the simplest version possible
- Add complexity incrementally, step by step, with each exercise building directly on the previous
- Write practice code, check your work against best practices, get feedback
- Practice taking direction, advice, even sharing code with collaborators
- Don't skip anything (even if it's "easy" or "obvious")

It really is that simple! Although "simple" isn't the same thing as "easy."

But if you're willing to commit, learning the right way will pay dividends forever.

You'll be the expert.

And you can do it with {props.hasPurchasedV1 ? `Epic React v2` : `Epic React`}.

{<h2 className="!-mt-10 !pt-7 text-center !pb-5">{props.hasPurchasedV1 ? `Epic React v2` : `Epic React`} will take you from "what's JSX?" to developing a complete, professional-grade, scalable application in a teamwork environment.</h2>}

{props.hasPurchasedV1 ? `When you upgrade to Epic React v2` : `When you enroll in Epic React`}, you'll get instant access to **7 workshops with 240 bite-sized lessons — all new, all React 19, and 100% TypeScript.** All you have to do is {props.hasPurchasedV1 ? `sign in` : `sign up`} and get started coding your very first exercise.

<p>{props.hasPurchasedV1 ? `You'll start by reviewing the fundamentals: a DOM node.` : `You'll start at the very beginning: with a DOM node.`}</p>

You'll {props.hasPurchasedV1 ? `learn and review` : `learn`} every part of React 19 — all the classic stuff, and all the new — separately and in concert.

Each new lesson will build on the one you did before.

{/* By the end, you'll develop @TODOFinalAppProjects. */}
{/* Projects: Calculator, Forms, Blog Search, Animated Tilt, Tic Tac Toe, Counter, Performant Globe, Searchable List of Cities, RSC Shipyard */}

<Projects />

By the end, you'll develop projects such as a blog search, animated tilt, tic-tac-toe, new user form, performant globe, calculator, counter, searchable list of cities, and RSC Shipyard.

### Along the way, you'll {props.hasPurchasedV1 ? `reinforce` : `learn`} professional coding practices

You'll master form handling, one of the trickiest (and most powerful) parts of interactive web development.

You'll learn how to develop for performance, and optimize your existing code. (Bonus: these same techniques apply to non-React apps, too!)

You'll learn how to use AI coding assistants for a massive productivity boost. I use mine in every Epic React video lesson. (They don't do the work for you, of course, but they sure can help!)

All while you practice developing React 19 apps within your virtual team. Your simulated guides, Peter the Project Manager and Kellie the Coworker, set specifications, provide suggestions and even code for you to build on, (almost) just like real life.

**And you don't have to do it alone**: every time you sit down to learn, you'll see the shining faces of your fellow students working on that same exact lesson at the same exact time… and you'll get lifetime access to our Epic React Discord channels.

So, whether you're an intermediate dev looking to {props.hasPurchasedV1 ? `review the fundamentals` : `learn React for the first time (lucky you!)`}…

…or an experienced React developer looking to {props.hasPurchasedV1 ? `learn whats new in React 19` : `level up`}…

**If you've been looking for your pathway to true React mastery? You've found it.**

Let's take a {props.hasPurchasedV1 ? `tour to see what's new in brand-new upgraded Epic React v2!` : `tour!`}


<IntroTourVideo />

### You are going to love learning with {props.hasPurchasedV1 ? `Epic React v2 more than ever.` : `Epic React.`}
{/* @TODO bulleted list of benefits here inc "IDE of choice" dad jokes etc. */}

You'll build expertise and master React while avoiding learning fatigue through fun and rewarding coding exercises. At every step you'll be encouraged and challenged while working at a sustainable pace.

* Use your favorite IDE to code
* Progress tracking
* Challenging exercises
* Fully supported with diffs, tests, and solutions
* Discord Community
* Frequent recommended break times
* Dad jokes

Your IDE, your setup, your preferred coding environment at every step of the way. This is how you work best. Not trapped in a browser.

Your progress is tracked and the next step is always clear. When you sit down to code, you won't waste time figuring out what to do next.

Your practice time will be spent actively coding fun exercises and not binge-watching video after video.

Code with confidence in a fully supported environment with diffs, tests, and solution videos from Kent.

**With {props.hasPurchasedV1 ? `Epic React v2` : `Epic React`}, you’re never alone.**

You’ll code with your peers via the shared presence feature. The Epic Discord server is always a click away if you get stuck, have questions, or want to share what you’ve built.

Avoid burnout by taking frequent recommended break times highlighted by (hilarious) dad jokes.

### Here’s how it works

<p>{props.hasPurchasedV1 ? `Epic React v2 is divided into 7 brand new` : `Epic React is divided into 7 complete`} self-paced
  workshops.</p>

You’ll clone a workshop when you are ready to work.

A few clicks get you up and running, watching the intro video for the workshop on `localhost`.

You'll work in your IDE of choice, coding as you would on the job.

* Understand the problem that is about to be solved
* Write the code for the solution
* Check out the diff
* Run the tests
* Watch Kent solve the problem

As you make changes for your solution to the exercises, the workshop app will update providing you with a full code diff comparing your solution with the suggested solutions.

You’ll also get a dedicated tab that provides tests for most exercises.

You're supported at every step and get the level of help you need to maximize learning.

### Practice professional skills

You’ll be working on practical problem-solving skills in the same way you do as a professional developer. These workshops simulate a real-world team environment and give you the feel of what it’s like to ship React apps in production.

Finally, you can watch Kent code the solution and talk about the decision-making process that went into solving it.

### Get your hands on that keyboard ASAP with Epic React

Getting started is always the hardest part of learning something new, and React is no exception. With {props.hasPurchasedV1 ? `the upgraded Epic React v2` : `Epic React`}, you can get over that hump quickly and start learning immediately.

It’s crucial to get your fingers on the keyboard with a proper development environment setup, and {props.hasPurchasedV1 ? `the new workshop learning environment of Epic React v2` : `Epic React`} takes the struggle out of getting started by making the “Hello World” easy and fun.

{<WorkshopAppScreenshot className="max-w-3xl mx-auto w-full" />}

Increasing your time at the keyboard makes sure you aren’t passively learning while an instructor drones on. Instead, you’ll be actively doing the job of a React developer as you learn the concepts that you need inside and out.

<section className="relative max-w-3xl mb-16 mt-16 pt-8 pb-8 mx-auto w-full">

  {' '}

  <div
    className="absolute left-0 top-0 h-px w-full bg-gradient-to-r from-transparent via-border to-transparent"
    aria-hidden="true"

  {<h2
    className="text-center">{props.hasPurchasedV1 ? `Ready to experience what's new in the upgraded Epic React v2?` : `Ready to experience Epic React for
    yourself?`}</h2>}

  The Get Started with React
  tutorial includes the first 4 workshop sections from the full course:

  {<TutorialWidget />}

  The Get Started with React 19 tutorial is a great introduction to React 19 and
  will let you explore the workshop app in your local environment to see for
  yourself how awesome it is.

  {<h2
    className="text-center text-balance">{props.hasPurchasedV1 ? `Everything you get when you upgrade to Epic React v2` : `Everything you get with Epic React`}</h2>}

  Starting with the fundamentals all the way through the latest in React Server
  Components, you'll learn everything you need to know to build
  production-ready React applications.

### There’s nothing like this level of training available anywhere else at any price.

Training is expensive. Live workshops cost hundreds of dollars per workshop. That's not including the travel costs and the time away from home.

<p>{props.hasPurchasedV1 ? `Epic React v2is 7 complete
  brand-new updated workshops` : `Epic React is 7 complete
  workshops`} . You don't have to leave your house to master React. You can
  learn
  it in your own time and at your own pace.</p>

**For a fraction of the cost of live training.**

<p>{props.hasPurchasedV1 ? `Epic React v2` : `Epic React`} is a serious bargain
  for the highest level of professional developer training.</p>
